      <description>A few days ago I was looking for a way to log all tracks that I listen to in iTunes. Something like Last.fm but that works local and for macOS. I did a quick search and couldn’t find anything (maybe there is something already). So I decided to built something simple on my own using AppleScript, which allows me to easily access the iTunes information I need.
Doing some research I found an article at Doug’s AppleScripts that described the problem I wanted to solve.</description>
