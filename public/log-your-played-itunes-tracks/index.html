<p>Doing some research I found an article at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doug’s AppleScripts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that described the problem I wanted to solve. Copy the code below in the Script Editor (or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get from GitHub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), change the path to the text file and save as an application and don’t forget to check the “Stay open after run handler”.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Run the app and voilà! I haven’t looked into possibilities to hide the dock icon or anything else. And I guess you can run the code with some modifications as a shell script in the background. Maybe I’ll look into it later.</p>
