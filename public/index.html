	I was looking for a way to run jupyer notebook without using a constantly open terminal or a screen session. On macOS there is a way to create services using a .plist file and the launchctl command.
Because I use different environments for all Python related stuff, it wasn’t immediately clear to me how to do this when I’ve installed Jupyter only in a pyenv. After some fiddling around, I finally solved it.&hellip;

	I’m a big fan of BitBar, an application that allows you to “Put anything in your Mac OS X menu bar” (macOS nowadays). People have already created more than 250 plugins which allow you to show plenty of information in the menubar. Basically any script that can be executed on the terminal and has some kind of output can be used to display this output.
This is how my BitBar output looks at the moment:&hellip;

	Following a request at the LaMetric forum I wrote a small Python script for displaying your current download and upload speed on a LaMetric Time. The script can run on your own laptop or server (preferred).
Basically you need to do two things:
Create an app for the LaMetric Time run the script that performs the speed test and push the results to the device 1. Create an indicator app This is quite an easy thing to do.&hellip;

	A new firmware for the LaMetric Time is out – version 1.7.5 has some nice things to offer for those of us who would like to use the device in home automation (sadly the documentation is not yet updated). While this has been announced in the change log for 1.7.4, there have been some bugs and there are still one or two things that needs fixing, but that’s just minor stuff.&hellip;

	<p>For nearly six months now I’ve been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dash<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as my sole earbuds. Before that I used the headphones Apple delivered with whatever iPhone I owned and I was quite happy with it – so you can see, that I don’t care that much about audio quality. I’ve tried high-end headphones but for me it’s not worth the money, simply because I didn’t hear that big of a difference. YMMV. This applies to everything in the review – it is deliberately subjective and I can’t promise that you will have the same experience but I think I can give you a good overview. If you are an athelete or music enthusiast who wants to know if the Dash is worth it, I’ll probably disappoint you – since I’m neither I probably don’t value the things that are important for you very much.</p>&hellip;

	A few days ago I was looking for a way to log all tracks that I listen to in iTunes. Something like Last.fm but that works local and for macOS. I did a quick search and couldn’t find anything (maybe there is something already). So I decided to built something simple on my own using AppleScript, which allows me to easily access the iTunes information I need.
Doing some research I found an article at Doug’s AppleScripts that described the problem I wanted to solve.&hellip;

	<p><strong>UPDATE (08.08.2016): Apparently you can get your api key at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://developer.lametric.com/user/devices">https://developer.lametric.com/user/devices</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> now.</strong></p>
<p>With the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LaMetric Time Firmware update 1.6.0<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the API for local push notifications changed and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my tutorial for the 1.5.0 firmware<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does’t work anymore.

	<p>UPDATE: This doesn’t work with firmware 1.6.0 – see updated article here: <a href="https://blog.aruehe.io/lametric-firmware-1-6-0-and-local-push/">LaMetric Firmware 1.6.0 and local push</a></p>
<p>With the latest firmware upgrade (1.50) the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LaMetric<!-- raw HTML omitted --> finally got support for local push – allowing you to sent messages to the LaMetric without needing an internet connection. Because some people in the support forums asked how to use local push I decided to write a tutorial (I do this on OS X).</p>&hellip;
